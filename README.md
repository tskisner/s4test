# CMB-S4 Package s4sim

This package is an example.  Add more description here.  The install instructions below
are generic and should not need to be modified.


## Package Installation

This package uses setuptools for package installation.  You can use the setup.py
directly for installation or use pip.  Using pip makes it possible to uninstall the
package cleanly.  Installation to a specific location can be done with:

    %>  pip3 install . --prefix=/some/place

OR

    %>  python3 setup.py install --prefix /some/place

If you specify a `--prefix` option, then that location should already be in your PATH /
PYTHONPATH environment.  For example, you must have previously set up your environment
with:

    %>  export PATH="/some/place/bin:${PATH}"
    %>  export PYTHONPATH="/some/place/lib/python3.x/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}"

Where `3.x` is the actual python version you are using.  If you do not specify a
`--prefix` option, the package will be installed to your python installation prefix.
**If** you are using a virtualenv or a conda environment for your development work
(always a good idea!) then it is safe to leave out the `--prefix` option and install the
package into your environment.

If you have used pip to do the installation, then you can uninstall with:

    %>  pip3 uninstall s4sim

If you want to be able to edit the source and have those changes show up in your
environment without re-installing, then you can use the package in develop / editable
mode.  This is done slightly differently depending on whether you use setup.py directly
or pip:

    %>  pip3 install -e . --prefix=/some/place

OR

    %>  python3 setup.py develop --prefix /some/place

These commands will fail unless the prefix is in your PYTHONPATH.


## Running Unit Tests

The unit tests are contained within the package itself.  This has the benefit that we
are certain to be running the tests on the installed package, rather than running tests
against a locally built (and perhaps different) version of the package.  After
installing the package (or using the develop / editable option), run tests with:

    %> python3 -c 'import s4sim.tests; s4sim.tests.run()'


## Package Development

When developing the code, you should install (e.g. with pip or conda) the "black" python
formatting package.  When making changes to the source, and before committing, run the
`format_source.sh` script in the top directory.  This applies formatting rules to all
the source files.
